Building My Portfolio with Angular and Signals

As a developer passionate about modular architecture and performance optimization, I recently built my personal portfolio using Angular — not just as a showcase, but as a playground for modern frontend techniques.

 Why Angular?
 
Angular’s powerful CLI, built-in routing, and component-based structure make it ideal for scalable projects. I used standalone components, lazy-loaded modules, and global SCSS management to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

Signals for Reactive State

One highlight is my use of Angular Signals for reactive state management. Instead of relying on traditional @Input() and @Output(), I used signal() to manage UI state like menu toggles and theme switching. This approach improves performance and simplifies change detection with OnPush.
